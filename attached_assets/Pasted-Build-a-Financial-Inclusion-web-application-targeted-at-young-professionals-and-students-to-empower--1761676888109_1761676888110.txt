Build a Financial Inclusion web application targeted at young professionals and students to empower them in managing their personal finances effectively. The app should address problems like overspending, poor budgeting, lack of saving, and misunderstanding financial concepts such as loans and investments.

Project Description:
Create a user-friendly platform that provides budgeting tools, expense tracking, savings goal setting, financial literacy content, and real-time spending alerts. The goal is to bridge the financial literacy gap by simplifying money management, motivating users to build savings, and reducing financial stress with notifications and educational material.

Features:
User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login via email and OAuth providers.

Income & Expense Tracking: Add income and expenditure with categories and dates. Display interactive visual summaries and trends.

Budget Planner: Users can set monthly/weekly budgets by category with alerts on overspending.

Savings Goals: Users create savings targets, monitor progress with motivational indicators.

Loan & Investment Calculators: Simple calculators to visualize loan payments and investment growth.

Notifications: Bill payment reminders, saving nudges, and budget warnings.

Secure Data Handling: Encrypt data at rest and in transit to ensure user privacy.

Technology Stack:

Styling: TailwindCSS or Material-UI.

Backend: Serverless API routes on Vercel with Node.js or Python for managing users, finances, and calculations.

Database: Use Supabase or Firebase for serverless, real-time database and authentication.

Authentication: Leverage Supabase Auth, Firebase Auth, or Clerk for easy and secure user sign-in/out.

Notifications & Caching: Use Vercel KV or Upstash Redis.

Deployment: Host, deploy, and automate on Vercel with CI/CD integrated with GitHub.
